  title: Cloud TSP detokenization API
  description: >
    # Introduction
    
    The API provies methods for detokenizing and sending notification
    
    # Security
    
    The API relies on different security layers:
    
    * At transport level, TLS Mutual Authentication is used.
    * At application level, sensitive card information (PAN) is encrypted using Java Web Encryption specification defined in RFC-7516 using Compact Serialization.
    
    ## Certificates for the client
    
    Two separate certificates would be required from the client. A client certificate for mutual TLS and a data encryption certificate.
    The client should generate a CSR using a 2048-bit or 4096-bit key, and the certificates will be generated by BankAxept.

        This endpoint performs the necessary cryptographical verifications to the transaction, 
        and returns a CipheredDetokenizedCard containing the card details.

        This endpoint is only suited for payment detokenization use.
